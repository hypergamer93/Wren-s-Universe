The CEO of Cateax corporation Vilniet is in a meeting with the 48 other CEOs in the Cateax-Syniliv Union of Great Corporations. He sees the sentient race that inhabits the newly-discovered planet Te’thiriskl as a potential economic partner in the long-term due to their fondness of capitalism. A partnership with the civilisation is proposed. The Cateax corporations would provide them with economic support and help them integrate into the galactic economy while the Syniliv corporations would offer reduced prices on all technologies exported to Te’thiriskl. In exchange, the inhabitants would give them unrestrained access to all of their planet’s natural resources and allow them to study the effects of wormhole travel on their planet.
