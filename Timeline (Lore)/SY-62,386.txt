After much negotiations, the Cateax-Syniliv-Human treaty of 62,386 is formed. The Cateax-Syniliv Union of Great Corporations would provide the humans with economic and technological aid while supporting their complete integration into the galactic economy. In return, the humans would provide them with limited access to their planets’ natural resources and unrestrained research of the effects of wormhole travel on their planet. The humans also would not cede any territory to any other civilisation (Especially the Lurzon Empire).

With the humans voting overwhelmingly in favour of accepting the finalised version of the treaty, it was accepted by Queen Elizabeth II on behalf of the human race on time interval 342.66, year 62,386.
