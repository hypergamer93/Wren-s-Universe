During a Gikik expeditionary journey, multiple Gikik vessels discover a massive hive mind-like being, or rather, it discovers them. The Virathasium make first contact with the significantly less advanced Gikik, and while in ordinary circumstances the Gikik might have been driven out, Virathasium took some interest in the species, and offered them a deal: After Gikik devours their first star, it will integrate them into it’s hive mind. The Gikik’s decision thus far leans towards yes, and with that, Virathasium sets up a station to monitor the Gikik for the purposes of waiting for a decision, and to eventually extract it.
