Food is scarce, and Gikik aboard the ship are starting to consume each other for resources. It was never supposed to go this way. They were so close to their destination, but had miscalculated the biomass needed to sustain their ship. Still 0.26 light years away from the resource-rich planet they were scouting, there was little to no hope they could get there in time.

Less and less Gikik are aboard the vessel as time goes on, leaving their conscious growing lesser and lesser as well. Soon, most memories of their home planet will have to be forfeited because there are not enough of them to maintain it. Truly, a terrible death. Days, weeks, months pass, and no hope remains. The consciousness is dead for good, leaving no memories or intelligence left. But now, in this hopeless state, something happens.

You see, the planet the Gikik were scouting was Ruig, the home of the technologically superior Groaloga, and as the ship drifts through space, something finds it, and pulls it into its bay. A Groaloga ship. The Groaloga are confused, but excited by the discovery of extraterrestrial life, but it didn’t seem to have any awareness, or be smart at all. Though they didn’t breathe the same air or think the same way, it was discovered how to feed the starving Gikik. 

No memories, no thoughts, but then, the tipping point was reached as 1500 individual Gikik inhabited a single form. From this point on, the Groaloga would have a native population of Gikik on their planet which they could use to study xenobiology, and communicate with them. To the Groaloga, it’s unknown where they came from, but, now that they have them, The Gikik of Ruig were in line with the Groalogas beliefs, and went through some genetic change from their counterparts back home
