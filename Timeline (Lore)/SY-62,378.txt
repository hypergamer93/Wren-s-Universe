It's been 15 years, well, 15 rotations around the new stars in the sky, since Earth left the Solar System. Many had died during that event. Many of the Human colonies have discovered ways that they can communicate with each other. Long internet cables still exist, and they've used those to develop one-way at a time communication between each other. Other colonies, however, are island colonies, so they can't communicate with others. Attempts are being made to figure out land transport to get between colonies, but many lack the materials required to do so.

16 rotations after Earth leaving the Solar System. Video communication is now a thing again. Land transport is developing nicely, and resource collection is growing. Communication is now continental. A new generation has been born on to this wasteland planet. With how the population is growing, it's unknown how much longer the food and water supplies will be able to keep everyone alive.
