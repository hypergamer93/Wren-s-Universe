Description: Known for their greed, the Lurzii are one of the most ancient and prominent civilisations in their galaxy. The vast majority of Lurzii are united under the Great Lurzon Empire, which will do anything to expand its already massive borders. 
a) Appearance: The Lurzii are large creatures(twice the height of an average human) that stand upright on 8 legs. They have black, shiny skin and their heads are split into 4 appendages- 2 that contain their eyes and 2 that contain their brains.
b) Politics: The Great Lurzon Empire does not discriminate in its endless quest for control over its neighbours. Their only allies are the wealthy states to the South which provide economic support to fuel its expansion, including the Cateax. The Lurzii are often on the receiving end of harsh criticism due to their numerous acts of genocide and planetary destruction.
c) Technology: Being one of the oldest races with its recorded history dating as far back as the 6,000s (universal calendar), the Lurzii have mastered the technology of warfare. Their enemies stand little chance against their massive starships and planetary-scale explosives.
