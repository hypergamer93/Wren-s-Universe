Description: 
a) Appearance: The Cateax are winged creatures that resemble dragonflies but are slightly larger than humans and can stand on 4 legs. They prefer warmer climates and have evolved to survive without sustenance for long periods of time. 
b) Society: The Cateax see profits as the ultimate goal of life and most nations practice Laissez-faire capitalism. High-ranking members of its society live on their homeland, Cheiria α while the rest live on the nearby planet Cheiria β.
c) Technology: Being a relatively new civilisation, the Cateax have only progressed enough to colonise planets in the Alpha System. However, uncontrolled capitalism and their low reliance on agriculture have allowed them to develop technologies faster than most civilisations
