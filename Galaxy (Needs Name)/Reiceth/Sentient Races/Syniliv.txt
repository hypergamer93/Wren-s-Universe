Name: Syniliv
Home planet/star system: Deseron/Reiceth
Number of planets occupied: 5
Native language/s: Zuddi, Old Zuddi, Sangiet
Population: 50 Billion
Description: 
Appearance: The syniliv are brown, bipedal creatures that resemble hedgehogs but have a large amount of fur instead of spikes. Despite being terrestrial creatures, colourful fins protrude from their necks, presumably for mating purposes.
Politics: The syniliv inhabit every planet in Reiceth, the closest star system to the Alpha system. They have formed a close alliance with the Cateax and heavily rely on imports from their relatively resource-rich planets. As they only emerged 4,000 years after the Southern civilisations gained independence from the Lurzon empire, they seldom partake in cooperation with the Lurzii and instead export technology to nearby races.
Technology: The syniliv owes much of their economic success to their cutting-edge manufacturing technology. 2 of the 5 planets in their star system have been purposed exclusively for turning imported resources into state-of-the-art technology rivalling even that of the Lurzon Empire. Despite being a relatively new civilisation (first space travel around the year 59,000), they have mastered faster-than-light spaceships and have begun the construction of a dyson sphere surrounding their sun.
