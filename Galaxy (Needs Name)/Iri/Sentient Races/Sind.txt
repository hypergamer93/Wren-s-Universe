Name: Sind
Home planet/star system: Iri Sinda, Iri
Number of planets occupied: 1
Native language/s: Sinlu, Yekna, Fong
Population: 3 Billion
Description: Biologically similar with Humans, the Sind are bipedal humanoids, standing at an average of 6 ft. They are still in their pre-space exploration stages of evolution, however they are quite a fertile race, and have already developed at least 3 complex regional languages. They are very skilled in mathematics, so space exploration shouldn't be too much of an issue to them. They believe that there are Extra Terrestrial life forms out there, most likely more advanced than them, but they'd be willing to reach out to them
