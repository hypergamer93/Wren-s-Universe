Name: Iliasi
Home planet/star system: Iri Ilia
Number of planets occupied: 1
Native language/s: Simplified Olis, Old Olis, Southern Pipe Speach, Old Izium
Population: 1 Bilion
Description:
a) Appearance: The Iliasi resemble large, six pointed star fish covered in thick white fur. In the places where their arms meet the central body they have large, black eyes, one per arm. They have a mouth orientated in the lower part of the body, ended in a beak and around it six long, thin tentacles, serving both as tongues and tools for precise manipulation, almost like human hands. When an Iliasi rests, it curls into a perfect ball and closes it's eyes, making it impossible to discern any of  it's body parts. 
b) Society: Iliasi cannot speak, the only noise they make is breathing, but they do have multiple written lenguages and evolved to be very empathetic. They are a very peaceful race and never had a conflict that costed the life's of more than a few Iliasi. At some point they decided that mass cooperation is much more productive. 
c) Technology: They do not have microchips yet, but they have a vast knowledge of cosmology and multiple competing theories of quantum mechanics. They have hundreds of thousands of simple perforated tape computers, but they still do most calculations manually. What they exceed in are art, philosophy and sociology. They believe in extraterrestrial life and that most life forms they are going to encounter in the universe will be at least as peaceful as they are.
