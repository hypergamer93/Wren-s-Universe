Description: 
The Gikik are a race of bug-like individuals who can come together to form conscious beings. As individuals, they have little intelligence at all, but are highly social and are adept at communicating simply. When together (in large quantities) they can communicate with each other as neurons to become a sentient creature. This form allows extreme growth and intelligence, and at certain sizes a pile of Gikik work better than some supercomputers. It is because of this that they advanced so fast. From their evolution, it took them only 4700 years (earth years) to establish themselves and become the dominant species (humans, for example, take 2 million years to do this). At the end of this time the Gikik are already a space-faring and wildly successful group. Some piles, billions strong, are able to terraform environments, destroy mountains, and level forests. This, of course, means millions upon millions of deaths, but, unlike most races, Gikik have little to no care for an individuals lives.
