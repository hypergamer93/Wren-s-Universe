Description:
Appearance - Bipedal humanoids. Two layers of skin, inside layer protector for organs, outside layer a strechier type of chitin to protect from the heat of the suns. Faces evolved two eyes slightly protruded to operate like frog eyes, also helping push down digestion. Range in chitin skin tone from Browns to greys to very muddy greens.
Society- Advanced in the sciences of architecture and synthetic materials/foods. Love oral art of music, specifically all types of throat singing in their culture. Most major civ sites have mandatory military service and a lot of societal matters hinge on militaristic complex. The main goal is to leave their ever evolving and eventually disappearing planet, but are wrapped up so much in wars over "perma land" sites that the progress on leaving goals are hamstringed. 
Tech - In a world where you must build vertical structures on small pieces of land for survival, you need a lot of materials. You also need a lot of food. But where are you to hunt or mine with ever shifting landscapes? Thus the advancement of synthetics, which the Muhash are fantastic at. Their skill of architecture is also impressive, and let's not forget war craft such as weapons and armor.
