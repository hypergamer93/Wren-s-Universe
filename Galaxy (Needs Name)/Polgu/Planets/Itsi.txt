Name: Itsi
Star system: Polgu
Planet type: Hot Jupiter
Radius: 54,110 km
Description: Itsi, to anyone looking upon it from the terrestrial worlds, is brighter than most stars, but of course it is a planet orbiting Polat. The planet, through its history, has lost and continues to lose mass to Polat due to orbiting at a close proximity. Luckily, it will still be around for billions of years.
