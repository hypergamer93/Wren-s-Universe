Description: the Groaloga are a bipedal race which has a flexible backbone and ribs, their mouths, comprised of 2 crushing and tearing ‘bones’, aren’t true jaws, but allow the Groaloga to subsist on meat and plants. Their bones are mostly made of silicone, and so are considered to be a sedimentary rock. They are highly social, and usually stay in pairs to trios. Also worth mentioning they respirate with Sulfur dioxide as well as oxygen.
