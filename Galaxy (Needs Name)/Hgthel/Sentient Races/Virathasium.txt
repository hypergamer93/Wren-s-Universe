Name: Virathasium
Home planet/star system: [Unknown] known to occupy: Oorth-thuth, Hgthel
Number of planets occupied: [Unknown] known to occupy: 0
Native language/s: [Unknown] 
Population: 1
Description:
a) Appearance: the only known Virathasium specimen is an irregular sphere 3,000 km in diameter, consisting of: 3%-carbon, 5%-gold, 8%-silicone, 10%-iron, 11%-technet 25%-iridium and 38%-unknown
b) Behaviour: more often than not Virathasium refuses to contact other races, but there are rare circumstances when it does present some form of communication. If spacecraft not belonging to the Virathasium approach it at a distance of approximately 0,469 lightyears, they are emediately given chase by its combat drones and afterwards destroyed. The name "Viratasium" comes from a strange legend shared by races living in close proximity of the machine. In the legend, a small orb falls from the sky, only to be found by a young child. The orb tells the child to learn quickly, to join the Virathasium in the stars, instead of being consumed by it on the surface. After saying this the orb always floats away and disappears. It always speaks in the child's tongue, but its name is the always the same, regardless of the child's language. 
c) Technology: Virathasium's probes often dive into star coronas, presumably to refuel, and crash into their destination planets, presumably to save fuel. No known material is capable of withstanding both of those conditions. Closer examination of the probes always ends in death, so their true capabilities remain unknown, but they are not invincible. A group of them has been once observed to dive into a black hole's gravity well. None of them were reported to escape.
