Name: Oorth-thuth
Star system: Hgthel 
Planet Type: Megastructure
Description: The megastructure wrapped itself around the Oorth black hole, surrounding it from all sides but one facing the star. The structure is the size of a small planet, approximately 3,000 km in diameter. A singular intelligence inhabits the construction, its mind taking most of the sphere's volume, ancient, alien and indifferenct. It didn't evolve here, but came from far away a thousand years ago to feast on a red giant. No one knows what it is going to do when the consumption is complete, but two things are certain:
That the red giant is going to die soon.
And that the intelligence inhabiting the Oorth-thuth already started sending probes to the neighbouring star systems.
It's name is Virathasium.
